ballot_measure_type
===================

A list of the various types of ballot measures. States may have different legal
definitions of each type; Wikipedia_ has more details about each type.  These
values are to help states with multiple types of non-candidate-based contests
distinguish between each type; as such, the definitions in this table are simple
guidelines. Ultimately it is up to the state or local election official to
choose the value which best describes the ballot measure(s) in their
jurisdiction.
