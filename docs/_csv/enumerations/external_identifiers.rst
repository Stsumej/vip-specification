ExternalIdentifiers
===================

The ``ExternalIdentifiers`` element allows VIP data to connect with external datasets (e.g.
candidates with campaign finance datasets, electoral geographies with `OCD-IDs`_ that allow for
greater connectivity with additional datasets, etc...). Examples for ``ExternalIdentifiers`` can be
found on the objects that support them:

* :ref:`single-xml-candidate`

* Any element that extends :ref:`single-xml-contest-base`

* :ref:`single-xml-electoral-district`

* :ref:`single-xml-locality`

* :ref:`single-xml-office`

* :ref:`single-xml-party`

* :ref:`single-xml-precinct`

* :ref:`single-xml-state`
