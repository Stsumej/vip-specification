  A list of the various types of ballot measures. States may have different legal
  definitions of each type; Wikipedia_ has more details about each type.  These
  values are to help states with multiple types of non-candidate-based contests
  distinguish between each type; as such, the definitions in this table are simple
  guidelines. Ultimately it is up to the state or local election official to
  choose the value which best describes the ballot measure(s) in their
  jurisdiction.
