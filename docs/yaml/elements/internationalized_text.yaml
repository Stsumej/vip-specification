description: "``InternationalizedText`` allows for support of multiple languages for\
  \ a string.\n``InternationalizedText`` has an optional attribute ``label``, which\
  \ allows the feed to refer\nback to the original label for the information (e.g.\
  \ if the contact information came from a\nCSV, ``label`` may refer to a row ID).\
  \ Examples of ``InternationalizedText`` can be seen in:\n\n* Any element that extends\
  \ :ref:`$$$-contest-base`\n\n* Any element that extends :ref:`$$$-ballot-selection-base`\n\
