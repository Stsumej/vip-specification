_name: Precinct
description: |-
  The Precinct object represents a precinct, which is contained within a Locality. While the id
  attribute does not have to be static across feeds for one election, the combination of
  :ref:`Source.VipId <$$$-source>`, :ref:`Locality.Name <$$$-locality>`, :ref:`Precinct.Ward <$$$-precinct>`,
  :ref:`Precinct.Name <$$$-precinct>`, and :ref:`Precinct.Number <$$$-precinct>` should remain constant across
  feeds for one election (NB: not all of the fields just mentioned are required -- omitting those
  non-required fields is fine).
